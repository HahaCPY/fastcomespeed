# FastComeSpeed

## Introduction
**FastComeSpeed** is the final project for our software engineering lab course. The game is inspired by "快來速", a famously efficient restaurant at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).

Our gameplay takes cues from the popular title "Overcooked 2", focusing on teamwork, time management, and fast-paced cooking challenges. Players must cooperate to serve customers, and overcome various kitchen obstacles—all while racing against the clock.

## Development Environment
This game was developed using [Cocos Creator 2.4.8](https://www.cocos.com/en/creator).
